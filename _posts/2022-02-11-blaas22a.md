title: Challenges of Adversarial Image Augmentations
abstract: Image augmentations applied during training are crucial for the generalization
  performance of image classifiers. Therefore, a large body of research has focused
  on finding the optimal augmentation policy for a given task. Yet, RandAugment [2],
  a simple random augmentation policy, has recently been shown to outperform existing
  sophisticated policies. Only Adversarial AutoAugment (AdvAA) [11], an approach based
  on the idea of adversarial training, has shown to be better than RandAugment. In
  this paper, we show that random augmentations are still competitive compared to
  an optimal adversarial approach, as well as to simple curricula, and conjecture
  that the success of AdvAA is due to the stochasticity of the policy controller network,
  which introduces a mild form of curriculum.
