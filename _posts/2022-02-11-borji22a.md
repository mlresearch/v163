title: Shape Defense
abstract: 'Humans rely heavily on shape information to recognize objects. Conversely,
  convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are biased more towards texture. This fact
  is perhaps the main reason why CNNs are susceptible to adversarial examples. Here,
  we explore how shape bias can be incorporated into CNNs to improve their robustness.
  Two algorithms are proposed, based on the observation that edges are invariant to
  moderate imperceptible perturbations. In the first one, a classifier is adversarially
  trained on images with the edge map as an additional channel. At inference time,
  the edge map is recomputed and concatenated to the image. In the second algorithm,
  a conditional GAN is trained to translate the edge maps, from clean and/or perturbed
  images, into clean images. The inference is done over the generated image corresponding
  to the inputâ€™s edge map. A large number of experiments with more than 10 data sets
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms against FGSM, $\ell_{\infty}$
  PGD, Carlini-Wagner, Boundary, and adaptive attacks. Further, we show that edge
  information can a) benefit other adversarial training methods, b) be even more effective
  in conjunction with background subtraction, c) be used to defend against poisoning
  attacks, and d) make CNNs more robust against natural image corruptions such as
  motion blur, impulse noise, and JPEG compression, than CNNs trained solely on RGB
  images. From a broader perspective, our study suggests that CNNs do not adequately
  account for image structures and operations that are crucial for robustness. The
