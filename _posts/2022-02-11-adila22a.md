title: 'Understanding Out-of-distribution: A Perspective of Data Dynamics'
abstract: Despite machine learning modelsâ€™ success in Natural Language Processing
  (NLP) tasks, predictions from these models frequently fail on out-of-distribution
  (OOD) samples. Prior works have focused on developing state-of-the-art methods for
  detecting OOD. The fundamental question of how OOD samples differ from in-distribution
  samples remains unanswered. This paper explores how data dynamics in training models
  can be used to understand the fundamental differences between OOD and in-distribution
  samples in extensive detail. We found that syntactic characteristics of the data
  samples that the model consistently predicts incorrectly in both OOD and in-distribution
  cases directly contradict each other. In addition, we observed preliminary evidence
  supporting the hypothesis that models are more likely to latch on trivial syntactic
  heuristics (e.g., overlap of words between two sentences) when making predictions
  on OOD samples. We hope our preliminary study accelerates the data-centric analysis
  on various machine learning phenomena.
