title: 'GOPHER: Categorical probabilistic forecasting with graph structure via local
  continuous-time dynamics'
abstract: We consider the problem of probabilistic forecasting over categories with
  graph structure, where the dynamics at a vertex depends on its local connectivity
  structure. We present GOPHER, a method that combines the inductive bias of graph
  neural networks with neural ODEs to capture the intrinsic local continuous-time
  dynamics of our probabilistic forecasts. We study the benefits of these two inductive
  biases by comparing against baseline models that help disentangle the benefits of
  each. We find that capturing the graph structure is crucial for accurate in-domain
  probabilistic predictions and more sample efficient models. Surprisingly, our experiments
  demonstrate that the continuous time evolution inductive bias brings little to no
  benefit despite reflecting the true probability dynamics.
