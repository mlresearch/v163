title: 'The Beauty Everywhere: How Aesthetic Criteria Contribute to the Development
  of AI'
abstract: "“Beauty” is a highly disputed word in philosophy and art. It also appears
  frequently in scientific debates. But what is the role of beauty in science, and
  how can it be useful to AI? In this paper, we argue that scientific progress depends
  on the diversity of the judgment of scientists, something that is only possible
  because multiple aspects are involved in the evaluation of theories. Particularly
  important within these criteria are those related to aesthetic considerations, such
  as simplicity, consistency, broadness, and fertility. We claim that AI should be
  less focused on accuracy and related metrics, and instead should aim at integrating
  epistemic measures related to these aesthetic concepts."
