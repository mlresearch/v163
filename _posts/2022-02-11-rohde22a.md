title: 'Causal Inference, is just Inference: A beautifully simple idea that not everyone
  accepts'
abstract: It is often argued that causal inference is a step that follows probabilistic
  estimation in a two step procedure, with a separate statistical estimation and causal
  inference step and each step is governed by its own principles. We have argued to
  the contrary that Bayesian decision theory is perfectly adequate to do causal inference
  in a single step using nothing more than Bayesian conditioning. If true this formulation
  greatly simplifies causal inference. We outline this beautifully simple idea and
  discuss why some object to it.
